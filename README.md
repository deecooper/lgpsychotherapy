<h2 align="center"> Testing </h2>

### W3c Validator

The website was tested using W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator. Any errors that were found throughout the process of creating this website were fixed. The final testing that was carried out on all pages out showed no errors.

### Other Testing 

The website was tested on different size screens using the website Responsinator(http://www.responsinator.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeecooper.github.io%2Flgpsychotherapy%2F) 
and Dev tools on Chrome. The website is responsive on all screen sizes.

Both forms on the website were tested several times. The main input fields require an entry before the user can submit the form. The email section only works if a user enters an email address.

I tested the website on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer.

The site was also tested by three people on different mobile devices and two desktops.

### Bugs

- The main bug that I had an issue with was the overflow-y: hidden property, which stopped my website from scrolling. I went through all of my code and realised it was the overflow-y property that was causing the problem.
- Another bug I encountered was the border: none value. I set the border none in my asterisk at the top of my CSS file. I soon realised it was causing the input fields on my form to have an entry field with no box border. I fixed this by removing the border property from the asterisk and adding the box border property to the input field in my CSS file.

### Known bugs

My website doesnt look the same on Internet Explorer. The colour scheme isnt working and the font looks different.

### Lighthouse

I ran a lighthouse audit on my website. The results of the audit are shown in the picture below

<h2 align="center"> Credits </h2>

### Content

- The images I used were downloaded off the Pixabay website 
(https://pixabay.com/)

- The video featured on the website was created by the developer

- The background music included in the video was downloaded from (https://www.bensound.com/)

- The image of Lorna Gavin, the counsellor was taken by the developer

- The logo on the website was purchased from the Logo Maker website
(https://www.logomaker.com/home-return)

- The social media icons in the footer were taken from a website called Font Awesome
(https://fontawesome.com/)

### Code

- The code for the social media links in the footer was taken from the love running website
https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/love-running-2.0-sourcecode/commit/a78fffc1efdeca3f6fb96e9be27b0ebee484eba8

My mentor Antonio Rodriguez helped me with the header element as I couldn’t get my logo and navigation links to line up with one another. 

He helped me write out this code which he researched on w3 schools

#container-header {
    display: flex;
}


#logo-holder{
    width: 30%;
    text-align: center;
    display: inline-block;
}

#logo-holder img{
    width: 40%;
    margin: auto;
    padding: 10px;
}

#logo-holder a {
    display: block;
    position: relative;
}

#menu-holder{
    display: inline-block;
}


I had issues making my whole button clickable and not just the text. I found the information here (https://www.codecademy.com/forum_questions/536ccab4548c35ad24001a2e)
I used the display: block property which fixed my issue.


I wanted to put a box shadow behind my image and video. I found out how to do it using w3 schools. I used the code and changed the shadow colour and size.
(https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/tryit.asp?filename=trycss3_box-shadow)
I used the background-blend mode property which I researched from stack overflow. I used this property to make my overlay visible
(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36679649/how-to-add-a-color-overlay-to-a-background-image/36679903)



### Further Testing

The website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer and Mozilla firefox. 
The website takes longer to load on internet explorer and the colour are distorted.
I got two friends to test the website on desktop and mobile devices.
